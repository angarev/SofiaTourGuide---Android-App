            Banya Bashi Mosque is a mosque in Sofia, Bulgaria, built by the famous architect and civil engineer Mimar Sinan. Its construction was completed in 1576, during the years of Ottoman domination. The mosque derives its name from the phrase Banya Bashi, which means Many Baths. The most outstanding feature of the Mosque is that it was actually built over natural thermal spas. One can even see the steam rising from vents in the ground near the Mosque walls. The Mosque is famous for its large dome, diameter 15 m, and the minaret rising high upward.        </item>
