            The remains of the north wall are exhibited in the underground floor of the Central Market Hall - Hali. The wall was built in a mixed construction of semi-rough and river stones, levelled rows of bricks. In the 6th-century AD under Emperor Justinian I, the castle was further enhanced with the optional external zone. It is believed that the city walls reached a height of 12 m, which made the centre of Serdica very well-protected.
